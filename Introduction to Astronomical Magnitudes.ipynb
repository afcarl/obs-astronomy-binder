Rather than focusing, for now, on a precise definition of flux density followed by integration over passbands to define fluxes in a band, and then defining magnitudes in terms of those, this will argue for a reasonable definition of magnitude in terms of counts from an image.\n",

High temperature stars produce photons that are, on average, higher energy than the average photon produced by a lower temperature star.\n",

    "One way to mitigate that is to take images through a filter that passes only a (relatively) narrow range of wavelengths. There will still be differences from star-to-star (or asteroid or other objet), but these differences will be much smaller than if one looks only at a narrow section of the spectrum.\n",
