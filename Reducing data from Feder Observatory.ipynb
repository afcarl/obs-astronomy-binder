    "### Reduction steps\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Overscan**: Do not subtract it unless you know you need to. If you subtract it, then you **must subtract overscan from all images** and you want these settings:\n",
    "    + Overscan region is all of `axis 0` and from `3076` to `3079` along the other axis.\n",
    "    + Fit a polynomial (0th order, or maybe first order).\n",
    "+ **Trim:** Trim the images if they have overscan. *If you trim one set of images you must trim them all.* The settings are:\n",
    "    + Keep all of `axis 0` and from `0` to `3073` along the other axis.\n",
    "+ **Subtract bias:** Do this only if you absolutely must (because you need to scale the darks). \n",
    "+ **Subtract dark:** Always. \n",
    "+ **Flat correct:** Do for light images....unless there are no flats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image combining\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Clip before combining:** For *calibration images* you should do this. Using sigma clip with both low and high threshold to 5 works reasonably well. \n",
    "+ **Combine images:** Typically you shuold choose to combine using average. If your goal in choosing median is to reject cosmic rays (for example), then clipping before combining works better.\n",
    "    + Only **scale** before combining when combining flats. This scales all images to so that their mdeian or average value is 1, then combines them. When combining flats this is almost always the right thing to do. \n",
    "+ **Group by:** This setting controls how the calibrated images are grouped to make masters. For bias and light images you usually don't want to set this. For darks it makes sense to combine only the dark images that have the same exposure time. \n",
    "    + By default, reducer sets \"Group by\" to `exposure` for darks; depending onyour setup it might (or might not) make sense to also group by temperature.\n",
    "    + By default, reducer set \"Group by\" to `exposure, filter` for flats, since flats with different filters should never be combined. That setting works fine for dome flats, but for sky flats, in which the exposure time is typically different for each image, the proper setting is just `filter`.\n"
